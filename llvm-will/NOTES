Cleanup tasks:

* Refactor:
  * patches (and when they're used)
  * config options (and when they're used)
* Fix the madness that is libcxx/libcxxabi standalone building atm
* overrideTriple: Separate setting host triple vs target triple!
* Separate /using/ LLVM/clang/libcxx (as dependencies) vs building with them (as toolchain):
  * setup-hook doesn't make sense when not acting as a toolchain.
  * Allow using tools like clang-format without necessarily using clang as the compiler.
* Fix using clang-format and similar, we need wrappers for these so they can find their include paths and such.
* Get rid of the libcxx setup-hook entirely, leave this to wrappers to handle.
* Update to match improvements/changes made upstream to 3.8/3.9
* Split projects again, looks like upstream has been working on standalone builds.
  (But for now leaving things combined to make sure they work...)
* Leverage improved build support in LLVM/Clang--I haven't followed it closely but
  they now support things involving multi-stage builds and a CMake cache.
* Use clang's "universal driver" support (or configuration file support, if that gets added)
  to avoid the various complete rebuilds we do while building for/against musl.
